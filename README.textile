h1. EGOGradientView
Created by enormego

EGOGradientView is a UIView that's layer backed by CAGradientLayer.  This let's you have UIView's with gradient backgrounds, without much hassle.
It works as a straight pass through to CAGradientLayer, with the exception of the "colors" property. The colors property allows you to send UIColor objects, as well as CGColorRefs, and will always return an NSArray of UIColor objects.
